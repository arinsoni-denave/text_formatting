    "industry trends": {
      "ai-driven data center expansion": "The rise of artificial intelligence is transforming the data center industry, driving unprecedented demand for power-intensive infrastructure. AI-related occupiers are increasingly influencing site selection, design, and operational requirements, prioritizing markets with scalable power capacity and advanced connectivity solutions.",
      "liquid cooling technologies": "As data centers handle more compute-intensive workloads, their heat transfer requirements have become more stringent. Liquid cooling has emerged as the main solution to manage heat transfer for new IT equipment while improving operational efficiency and reducing energy consumption.",
      "power and capacity constraints": "There could be a data center supply deficit of more than 15 GW in the United States by 2030. Demand for AI-ready capacity is the main driver, with analysis suggesting a 33% average annual rise in AI-ready data center capacity between 2023 and 2030. By 2030, around 70% of total demand will be for data centers equipped to host advanced AI workloads.",
      "sustainability and energy efficiency": "Regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on data center sustainability. For instance, the European Commission adopted a regulation to assess data center sustainability, aiming to increase transparency, improve efficiencies, reduce energy and water consumption, promote renewable energy, and enhance grid efficiency."
