Their tech stack shows minimal cloud spend ($7K total across AWS, GCP, Azure) and focuses on manufacturing systems (Oracle Database, JD Edwards ERP, Microsoft SQL Server) rather than customer service technologies. No CRM solutions like Salesforce are present in their stack, and there's no evidence of existing contact center infrastructure. While they operate 70+ plants serving diverse industries that could generate customer interactions, their core business is B2B packaging manufacturing, not customer service-intensive operations typical of CES prospects.",
      "factors increasing the score": "- Large employee base (1,001-5,000) suggests potential for customer service operations\n\n- Multi-location presence (70+ plants) could require centralized customer support\n\n- Serves diverse industries (pharmaceutical, dairy, food, chemicals) that may have compliance requirements\n\n- Existing cloud presence with AWS, GCP, and Azure provides foundation for cloud-native solutions\n\n- Microsoft-heavy productivity stack could integrate well with CES connectors",

Google's Dialogflow CX virtual agents can guide customers through outage reports and equipment troubleshooting via voice, chat, and image upload, dramatically reducing inbound call volume.\n\n- Your customer service teams probably spend significant time manually summarizing interactions and ensuring compliance across pharmaceutical and industrial chemical packaging requirements. Agent Assist's real-time call summarization with automatic compliance scoring can slash post-call paperwork while tightening audit trails for regulatory reviews.\n\n- Managing seasonal demand spikes for your packaging solutions likely strains your support capacity, especially with your recent facility expansions in Alabama and Pennsylvania. Google's elastic pay-per-use model automatically scales your contact center resources up or down, aligning costs with actual demand without over-provisioning.\n\n- Your sales teams across multiple regions probably miss upselling opportunities during customer calls about packaging solutions. Agent Assist provides real-time transcript analysis and generative reply suggestions during live calls, helping representatives identify cross-sell moments for your sustainable packaging options.\n\n- With your diverse customer base spanning pharmaceuticals to food packaging, tracking customer sentiment and emerging issues across all touchpoints is challenging. Conversational Insights can cluster contact trends like \"sustainability requirements\" or \"delivery delays\" so your CX and supply chain teams can respond the same day.\n\n- Your recent acquisitions and facility expansions likely created disconnected customer data across multiple systems including your Oracle and SAP platforms. Google CES offers one-click connectors to Salesforce CRM and other enterprise systems, unifying customer interactions without complex integration projects.\n\n- Quality assurance across your 4,000 employees and multiple facilities probably requires extensive manual review of customer interactions.
