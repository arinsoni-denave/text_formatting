      "detailed reasoning": "Allan Myers is a $750M+ heavy civil construction company with 2,200+ employees, meeting CES revenue thresholds but falling short on agent count requirements (â‰¥100 agents). Their tech stack shows AWS/Azure usage and existing CX solutions (ServiceNow, SAP CRM), indicating some IT sophistication. However, as a B2B construction company serving contractors and government entities, their customer interaction volume appears significantly lower than CES's ideal 2M+ annual interactions. Their industry focus on infrastructure projects suggests limited multilingual or peak-season support needs that typically drive CES adoption.",
      "factors increasing the score": "- Revenue of $750M+ exceeds CES minimum threshold of $500M\n\n- Large workforce of 2,200+ employees indicates organizational scale\n\n- Existing cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure) suggests technology adoption capability\n\n- Current CX solutions (ServiceNow, SAP CRM) show investment in customer management\n\n- Multi-state operations across Mid-Atlantic region could benefit from unified platform",
      "factors decreasing the score": "- B2B construction business model likely generates far fewer than 2M annual customer interactions\n\n- Industry doesn't typically require multilingual support or experience peak-season volume spikes\n\n- Limited evidence of contact center operations or high-volume customer service needs\n\n- Construction industry interactions are typically project-based rather than high-frequency support\n\n- No clear indicators of agent churn, wait times, or containment issues that trigger CES adoption",
      "potential next steps": "- Qualify actual customer interaction volume and agent count through discovery call\n\n- Explore if they handle contractor/supplier inquiries that could benefit from automation\n\n- Investigate potential for virtual agents in project status inquiries or bid processes"
