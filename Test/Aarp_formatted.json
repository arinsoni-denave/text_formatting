Google's Dialogflow CX virtual agents can handle routine inquiries like membership benefits and billing questions, deflecting up to 50% of calls while maintaining the personalized service AARP members deserve.\n\n- With members calling about everything from Medicare guidance to fraud protection, your agents need instant access to relevant information during conversations. Agent Assist provides real-time transcription and smart reply suggestions, helping agents resolve member inquiries up to 90 seconds faster like Best Buy achieved.\n\n- Your extensive use of Salesforce CRM and multiple contact channels creates data silos that slow down member service. Google CES offers native Salesforce integration, allowing seamless data flow between your CRM and contact center without complex middleware or custom development work.\n\n- Managing quality assurance across thousands of member interactions manually consumes significant supervisor time and creates inconsistent scoring. Quality AI automatically scores call compliance and soft skills, freeing your supervisors to focus on targeted coaching rather than administrative QA tasks.\n\n- Members contacting AARP about Social Security, Medicare, and caregiving issues often express frustration or confusion that agents need to address sensitively. Conversational Insights provides real-time sentiment analysis, helping agents adjust their approach mid-conversation to better support members during stressful situations.\n\n- Your advocacy work requires understanding member concerns across all touchpoints, but manually analyzing thousands of interactions delays issue identification. Topic mining through Conversational Insights automatically clusters emerging themes like \"prescription drug costs\" or \"Social Security changes,\" enabling faster policy response.\n\n- Seasonal spikes around Medicare enrollment periods overwhelm your contact center capacity, forcing members to wait longer for assistance. Google CES's elastic pay-per-use model automatically scales resources during peak periods, ensuring members get timely support when they need it most without paying for unused capacity year-round.",

(1 = Not confident, 5 = Very confident)\n\n- Are you currently able to automatically analyze and score 100% of your member service interactions for quality assurance and compliance purposes, or do you rely primarily on manual sampling methods?\n\n- Would reducing average handle time by 30-45% through AI-powered agent assistance while improving first-call resolution rates align with your current operational goals for member services?"
