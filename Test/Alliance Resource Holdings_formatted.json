Their minimal cloud spend ($5K AWS, $7K productivity tools) suggests limited IT investment appetite. While they have some technology initiatives through Matrix Design Group (mining safety systems) and appointed a Senior VP of Operations & Technology, there's no evidence of customer service operations, call centers, or multilingual support needs that would drive CES adoption. The company's core business focus remains coal production and mineral extraction rather than customer experience transformation.",
