Their AWS-heavy tech stack ($12K monthly spend) with minimal GCP presence ($0 identifiable spend) indicates potential budget constraints for CES investment. While financial services face compliance requirements that CES addresses, Alkami's B2B focus on providing digital banking platforms to other institutions rather than direct customer service operations reduces CES applicability.",

      "factors decreasing the score": "- Primary business model serves B2B financial institutions rather than direct consumer contact center operations\n\n- Limited cloud spending ($12K monthly AWS) suggests constrained IT budgets for major CES investment\n\n- Minimal Google Cloud adoption despite existing Looker usage indicates preference for AWS ecosystem\n\n- No clear indication of large-scale agent operations meeting ≥100 agent threshold\n\n- Current tech stack heavily weighted toward AWS services reducing likelihood of multi-cloud CES adoption",
      "potential next steps": "- Conduct discovery call to understand actual contact center agent count and customer service operations scale\n\n- Explore how their financial institution clients might benefit from CES white-label solutions\n\n- Assess potential for CES integration within their digital banking platform offerings to end-clients"

          "talking points": "- Your 2024 acquisition of MANTL shows you're prioritizing seamless digital onboarding, but customer inquiries about account opening still likely flood your call centers. Dialogflow CX virtual agents can handle balance checks, application status, and basic banking queries 24/7, deflecting up to 50% of routine calls like Discover Financial Services achieved.\n\n- With 20 million digital banking users and revenue guidance targeting $440-445 million for 2025, peak transaction periods probably strain your support teams. Google CES elastic pay-per-use scaling automatically handles volume spikes without hiring temporary staff, while Agent Assist provides real-time transcription and smart replies to reduce average handle time by 90 seconds like Best Buy experienced.\n\n- Your medium-level investment in AI tools like AWS SageMaker suggests you're exploring automation, but manual quality monitoring across customer interactions remains time-intensive. Quality AI automatically scores compliance adherence and soft skills across all calls, letting supervisors focus coaching efforts where they'll have the most impact on customer satisfaction.\n\n- Supporting both retail and business banking clients means agents juggle complex product knowledge during cross-sell opportunities. Agent Assist surfaces relevant product suggestions and generates reply drafts in real-time during calls, helping agents confidently recommend appropriate financial solutions without lengthy research pauses.\n\n- Your partnership with BioCatch for fraud prevention shows security focus, but customers calling about suspicious activity need immediate, accurate responses. CES real-time topic modeling flags spikes in \"account takeover\" or \"card dispute\" complaints, letting your risk teams react within minutes instead of discovering patterns through weekly reports.\n\n- With Salesforce CRM already in your tech stack, integrating Google CES through native connectors means your agents get customer context instantly without switching between systems. This seamless workflow reduces call wrap-up time and ensures every interaction builds on previous conversations for better customer relationships.\n\n- Your 2024 expansion to 272 financial institutions means handling multilingual support needs as you grow nationally. Dialogflow CX virtual agents operate in 100+ languages with consistent service quality, eliminating the complexity and cost of maintaining specialized language-specific support teams.",
