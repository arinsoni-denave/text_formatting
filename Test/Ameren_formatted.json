      "detailed reasoning": "Ameren is a $5-10B Fortune 500 electric/gas utility serving 2.4M electric and 900K gas customers across Missouri/Illinois, meeting CES revenue thresholds. However, critical ICP misalignment emerges: utilities typically handle customer service through specialized energy/billing inquiries rather than the high-volume, multilingual support scenarios where CES excels. Their existing CX stack includes Genesys, Salesforce Service Cloud, Oracle CX Suite, and Avaya systems, suggesting established contact center infrastructure. While they have substantial IT investments ($26.3B planned 2025-2029), most focuses on energy grid modernization rather than customer service transformation. Limited cloud spend ($3K AWS) indicates conservative technology adoption, contrasting with CES's cloud-native architecture requirements.",
      "factors increasing the score": "- Fortune 500 company with $5-10B revenue exceeds CES minimum thresholds\n\n- 8,615 employees serving 3.3M total customers could generate significant interaction volumes\n\n- Existing Google Cloud Platform usage (BigQuery, Looker) shows GCP familiarity\n\n- Substantial technology investments and digital transformation initiatives\n\n- Multi-state operations could benefit from unified contact center platform",
