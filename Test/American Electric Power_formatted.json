Let's explore how this scales with your ambitious $54 billion infrastructure investment.",
      "key insights": "- AEP's 12.3% commercial load growth and data center expansion creates complex customer inquiries beyond traditional support capabilities. Dialogflow CX virtual agents handle routine billing and outage requests in 100+ languages, enabling human agents to focus on technical consultations.\n\n- With 5.6 million customers across 11 states and existing Cisco contact center infrastructure, agents likely struggle with lengthy resolution times. Agent Assist provides live transcription and Smart Reply suggestions, reducing average handle time by 30-45% like Best Buy achieved.\n\n- AEP's $54 billion infrastructure investment and AI initiatives generate unprecedented customer service complexity requiring enhanced quality monitoring. Conversational Insights delivers 100% automated quality assurance coverage versus typical 5% manual sampling, identifying emerging issues in real-time.\n\n- Managing contact center capacity across multiple states with unpredictable seasonal demand creates operational challenges. Elastic CCaaS offers pay-per-use scaling that automatically adjusts with demand, eliminating fixed licensing costs while maintaining service quality during peak periods."
