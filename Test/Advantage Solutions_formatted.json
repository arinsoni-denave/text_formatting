As an advertising/marketing services company serving 4,000+ CPG brands with omnichannel retail solutions, they likely have significant customer service operations but lack confirmation of ≥100 agents. Their tech stack shows $1.5M cloud spend ($1M AWS, $500K GCP) with existing CX solutions (Zendesk, Oracle Siebel) and productivity tools (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365). The company's 2024 \"year of investment\" in AI/technology transformation, $90-110M CapEx plans, and focus on digital commerce align well with CES capabilities, but the advertising industry fit is less optimal than traditional high-interaction sectors.",
      "factors increasing the score": "- Revenue of $3.6B significantly exceeds $500M ICP threshold\n\n- Existing $500K GCP spend indicates Google Cloud familiarity and relationship\n\n- Current CX tech stack (Zendesk, Oracle Siebel) suggests potential for modernization\n\n- 2024 strategic focus on AI transformation and generative AI implementation with Genpact\n\n- Substantial CapEx budget ($90-110M) demonstrates investment capacity for technology upgrades",
      "factors decreasing the score": "- No confirmation of ≥100 agents or ≥2M annual interactions requirement\n\n- Advertising agency industry less aligned than traditional high-interaction sectors\n\n- Existing CX solutions may indicate recent investments or vendor lock-in\n\n- AWS dominance ($1M vs $500K GCP) suggests stronger AWS relationship\n\n- Recent technology transformation initiatives may reduce appetite for additional major changes",
      "potential next steps": "- Qualify agent count and annual interaction volumes to confirm ICP fit\n\n- Explore CX modernization opportunities given existing Zendesk/Siebel implementations\n\n- Leverage existing $500K GCP relationship to position CES as natural expansion"

          "talking points": "- With your Oracle and SAP systems handling massive transaction volumes, you're likely seeing agents struggle with complex order-to-cash queries during peak seasons. Dialogflow CX can deflect up to 50% of routine billing and status calls through natural language self-service, letting your team focus on high-value customer relationships.\n\n- Your recent AI investments and Databricks analytics platform show you're serious about automation, but manual call quality management across your 4,000+ CPG brand relationships must be overwhelming. Quality AI automatically scores agent performance and compliance adherence, reducing QA workload by hours per supervisor weekly.\n\n- Given your 2024 transformation into a \"future-focused, insights-driven provider,\" you need real-time visibility into customer sentiment across your omnichannel operations. Conversational Insights clusters contact drivers like \"product availability\" or \"promotional issues\" so your merchandising teams can act the same day, just like Best Buy improved their resolution times by 90 seconds.\n\n- Your Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 environments suggest agents are juggling multiple systems during customer calls, slowing resolution times. Agent Assist provides real-time transcription and smart reply suggestions directly in their workflow, helping agents close cases faster while improving customer satisfaction scores.\n\n- With your high cloud spend on AWS and Google Cloud Platform, you understand the value of elastic scaling during demand spikes. Google CES's pay-per-use model automatically scales conversational capacity during your seasonal promotional campaigns, eliminating the need to over-provision expensive contact center seats.\n\n- Your partnership with Zendesk for customer service shows you value integrated workflows, but ticket deflection is probably a constant challenge. Google CES connects natively with Zendesk, allowing virtual agents to resolve routine cases before they become tickets, reducing agent workload and improving customer wait times.\n\n- Your recent leadership focus on \"strengthening culture and enhancing processes\" aligns perfectly with AI-powered agent coaching. Agent Assist's real-time guidance helps new hires get up to speed faster while providing performance insights that help experienced agents improve their upselling effectiveness across your retail partnerships.",
