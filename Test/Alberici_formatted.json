      "detailed reasoning": "Alberici fails to meet CES ICP criteria significantly. As a construction company with $3.1B revenue, they exceed the revenue threshold but operate in an industry with limited customer service needs compared to CES target sectors. Their tech stack shows minimal cloud spend ($6K total) and no existing CX solutions, indicating low IT investment appetite. The construction industry typically requires project-based communication rather than high-volume customer interactions that would benefit from virtual agents or contact center automation.",
