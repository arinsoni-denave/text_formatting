Their tech stack shows minimal cloud investment ($15K total) with basic AWS/Azure usage, indicating limited IT budget for CES implementation. While they have CX solutions like Salesforce CRM and LiveChat, these suggest simple customer service needs rather than complex contact center requirements. The company lacks compliance mandates (PCI-DSS, HIPAA) that would drive security requirements, and their real estate business model doesn't align with CES's contact center value propositions.",

Google CES's elastic pay-per-use model automatically scales capacity during busy times, preventing student frustration and reducing overtime costs.\n\n- Managing multilingual support for your diverse student population across multiple continents creates staffing challenges. Dialogflow CX virtual agents handle routine inquiries in 100+ languages, deflecting up to 50% of basic calls about housing applications, maintenance requests, and lease information.\n\n- Your facilities teams probably spend hours manually categorizing maintenance requests and housing complaints from students. Conversational Insights automatically clusters contact drivers like \"AC repair\" or \"WiFi issues,\" letting your operations teams prioritize and respond the same day.\n\n- With your current Salesforce CRM deployment, student service agents likely toggle between multiple systems during calls, slowing resolution times. Agent Assist provides real-time transcription and smart reply suggestions within your existing Salesforce workflow, reducing average handle time by up to 90 seconds like Best Buy achieved.\n\n- Your residence life programs require consistent quality monitoring across hundreds of properties, but manual call reviews are time-intensive. Quality AI automatically scores agent performance and compliance adherence, freeing supervisors to focus on targeted coaching where it matters most.\n\n- Student emergencies and urgent housing issues need immediate escalation, but current routing may miss critical signals. Real-time sentiment detection automatically identifies keywords like \"safety concern\" or \"urgent maintenance\" and routes these calls to specialist queues instantly.\n\n- Post-call documentation for housing agreements and maintenance requests probably creates administrative bottlenecks for your staff. Generative AI call summarization automatically creates structured notes and action items, reducing paperwork time and improving follow-up consistency across your 200+ property portfolio.",

(Yes/No)\n\n- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your current ability to automatically scale customer support capacity during peak periods like move-in weeks, semester starts, and housing application deadlines?
