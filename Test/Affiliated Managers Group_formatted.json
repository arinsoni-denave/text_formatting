      "detailed reasoning": "AMG is a $2B-3B revenue asset management firm with 1,000-5,000 employees, falling below CES's ideal customer profile threshold of ≥100 agents or ≥2M annual interactions. Their tech stack shows minimal contact center technology investment ($15K total cloud spend across AWS/GCP/Azure), with no existing CX solutions spending detected. As a B2B investment management company serving institutional clients and operating through independent affiliate firms, their customer service requirements are fundamentally different from high-volume consumer-facing industries that CES typically serves. While they meet revenue requirements, their business model suggests limited need for extensive contact center infrastructure.",
      "factors increasing the score": "- Revenue of $2B-3B exceeds CES minimum threshold of $500M\n\n- Employee count of 1,000-5,000 indicates organizational scale\n\n- Global operations across US, Europe, UK, Middle East, and Asia suggest potential multilingual support needs\n\n- Existing cloud infrastructure with AWS, GCP, and Azure provides foundation for CES integration\n\n- Financial services industry has compliance requirements (GDPR, data residency) that align with CES security capabilities",
      "factors decreasing the score": "- B2B asset management model likely generates low customer interaction volumes compared to CES requirements\n\n- No current spending on CX solutions indicates minimal contact center investment priority\n\n- Limited cloud vendor spending ($15K total) suggests constrained technology budget allocation\n\n- Business operates primarily through independent affiliate relationships rather than direct customer service\n\n- Industry focus on institutional clients typically requires relationship-based rather than high-volume transactional support",
      "potential next steps": "- Conduct discovery call to understand actual customer interaction volumes across all affiliate operations\n\n- Explore potential use cases for investor relations, client onboarding, or regulatory compliance communications\n\n- Assess if any affiliate firms have consumer-facing operations requiring contact center capabilities"
