      "elevator pitch": "With AECOM's $16.1B revenue spanning 150+ countries and 51,000 employees, customer experience complexity is escalating. Engineering firms face 22% longer handle times as infrastructure projects demand specialized technical support across global time zones.\n\nCan your current CX infrastructure scale to match AECOM's ambitious 5-8% annual growth targets while maintaining the technical expertise clients expect from your #1-ranked water and transportation services?\n\nGoogle's Customer Engagement Suite offers multilingual virtual agents and AI-powered insights that helped Bell Canada save $20M quarterly in operations costs. Let's explore how this could streamline AECOM's global client interactions.",
      "key insights": "- AECOM's $16.1B revenue across 150+ countries creates multilingual support complexity for infrastructure consulting clients. CES's Dialogflow CX handles inquiries in 100+ languages with 50% call deflection rates.\n\n- Managing 51,000 global employees generates massive conversation data from technical project discussions. CES's Conversational Insights provides real-time sentiment tracking and topic clustering for emerging issues.\n\n- AECOM's current limited CX investment ($12K Salesforce) suggests inefficient manual quality processes across global operations. CES's Quality AI delivers 100% automated scoring versus typical 5% manual sampling.\n\n- Infrastructure consulting firms face seasonal project spikes requiring flexible staffing models for client support. CES's elastic CCaaS provides pay-per-use scaling, eliminating fixed licensing costs during demand fluctuations."
