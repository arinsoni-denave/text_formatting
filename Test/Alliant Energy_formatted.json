Grid modernization investment has grown at a 37% compound annual growth rate since 2012. Distributed intelligence plays a crucial role, with edge devices like smart meters and sensors integrating into grid management systems, providing localized insights that help utilities make faster decisions, isolate outages, and restore power with minimal manual intervention.",
      "renewable energy integration": "The utilities industry is primarily driven by a shift to cleaner and more resilient energy systems. Renewable energy growth and decarbonization efforts are reshaping power generation strategies, while energy storage advances improve power delivery stability and flexibility. Solar PV costs have declined by 90% since 2010, and energy providers are ramping up the shift to renewables. Customers are also adopting solar energy at an increasing rate, with over 219 gigawatts of solar capacity installed across the nation.",
      "artificial intelligence and advanced analytics": "Generative AI has a broad range of use cases in the utility sector, including energy management, grid optimization, asset management, and customer service. It can optimize energy consumption patterns in real-time based on usage forecasts, demand, or weather conditions. AI and predictive analytics are helping utilities forecast demand, fine-tune energy distribution, and keep supply steady. By 2030, as much as 70% of utilities in developed markets are expected to rely on AI for daily operations.",
      "energy storage and electric vehicle integration": "Energy storage technologies will play an increasingly important role in ensuring the reliability of renewable energy systems. As more renewable energy sources like solar and wind are integrated into the electric grid, energy storage will be essential for managing fluctuations in power generation. It allows businesses and utilities to store excess energy during periods of low demand and release it when needed, which is crucial for balancing intermittent renewable sources and ensuring grid stability."
