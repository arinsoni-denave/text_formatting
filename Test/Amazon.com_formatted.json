      "detailed reasoning": "Amazon fails fundamental ICP criteria as a direct competitor with its own contact center platform (Amazon Connect). With $638B revenue and 1.5M+ employees, Amazon exceeds size thresholds but represents a strategic conflict. Their extensive AI initiatives, cloud infrastructure, and customer service operations indicate sophisticated internal capabilities that would compete directly with CES. Despite potential multilingual needs across global operations and compliance requirements, Amazon's position as a technology provider with competing solutions creates an unsurmountable barrier.",
      "factors increasing the score": "• Massive scale with 1.5M+ employees and global operations requiring extensive customer service\n• Revenue of $638B far exceeds $500M threshold with continued growth\n• Multilingual requirements across 21 international marketplaces\n• Strong AI/ML initiatives and technology infrastructure investments\n• Compliance-heavy operations across regulated industries and government sectors",
      "factors decreasing the score": "• Direct competitor with Amazon Connect CCaaS platform offering similar capabilities\n• Extensive internal AI and cloud infrastructure making external solutions redundant\n• Owns competing virtual agent, analytics, and telephony technologies\n• Strategic conflict as technology vendor in contact center space\n• Established internal customer service operations and platforms",
      "potential next steps": "• Acknowledge competitive relationship and explore potential partnership opportunities in complementary areas\n• Monitor for any organizational changes that might create separation between business units\n• Consider engagement with specific subsidiaries that might have independent technology decisions"
