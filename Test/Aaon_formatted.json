          "talking points": "- Your HVAC equipment business faces seasonal demand spikes where customer inquiries about installations and service appointments overwhelm your contact center during peak construction periods. Google's Dialogflow CX virtual agents can handle routine scheduling and product specification questions 24/7, achieving up to 50% call deflection like retail leaders have seen.\n\n- With AAON's rapid expansion into data center cooling solutions and the Memphis facility scaling up, your customer service team struggles to maintain consistent product knowledge across new offerings. Agent Assist provides real-time transcription and smart reply suggestions during live calls, helping agents resolve technical queries up to 90 seconds faster like Best Buy achieved.\n\n- Your current CRM setup with Salesforce and HubSpot creates information silos when customers contact you through different channels about warranty claims or technical support. Google CES offers native Salesforce integration, ensuring customer context flows seamlessly between self-service bots and live agents without manual data entry.\n\n- As your BASX brand grows in the specialized data center market, quality assurance becomes critical but manual call monitoring is time-intensive and inconsistent. Quality AI automatically scores agent interactions for compliance and soft skills, letting supervisors focus coaching efforts where they deliver the most impact.\n\n- Your field service teams often receive complex technical calls about custom HVAC installations that require specialized expertise, creating bottlenecks when senior engineers are unavailable. Conversational Insights can detect urgency keywords and route high-priority technical issues directly to expert queues, improving first-call resolution rates.\n\n- With Google Workspace already in your productivity stack, training your team on yet another communication platform creates adoption friction and additional licensing costs. Google CES integrates natively with your existing Google environment, reducing training time and leveraging your current medium-level cloud investment more effectively.\n\n- Your recent 70% backlog increase means customer status inquiries are spiking, but manual order tracking updates consume valuable agent time that could focus on technical sales support. Self-service chatbots can handle routine order status and delivery questions automatically, freeing your sales team to focus on the complex engineering consultations that drive revenue.",
          "probing questions": "- Given AAON's remarkable 374% growth in BASX-branded data center solutions and your expansion into the Memphis facility, how is your current customer service infrastructure adapting to handle the surge in technical inquiries and support requests from this rapidly growing segment?\n\n- With your recent leadership transitions and geographic expansion across four manufacturing locations, what challenges are you experiencing in maintaining consistent customer experience quality and knowledge sharing across your distributed service teams?\n\n- As AAON continues investing heavily in R&D for innovative HVAC solutions like your Alpha Class heat pumps, how are you currently capturing and analyzing customer feedback to inform product development priorities and identify emerging market needs?\n\n- Considering your strong presence in both traditional HVAC markets and the high-growth data center cooling space, what specific pain points do you face when customers need support across multiple product lines or require specialized technical expertise?\n\n- On a scale of 1-5, how effectively does your current customer service technology stack handle peak demand periods, particularly during major project deployments or seasonal HVAC maintenance cycles?\n\n- Does your organization currently have the capability to provide real-time, multilingual customer support to match your global expansion plans and diverse customer base?\n\n- Are you satisfied with your current ability to automatically monitor and ensure quality consistency across all customer interactions, especially given your recent organizational restructuring and new facility operations?"

          "probing questions": "- With your current HubSpot CRM and Salesforce setup, how much time do your agents spend switching between systems during customer calls, and are they manually entering the same information multiple times?\n\n- Given your rapid 70% backlog growth and expansion into data center solutions, how are you currently handling the surge in technical support inquiries when your regular agents may not have deep BASX product expertise?\n\n- When customers call about your specialized HVAC equipment installations, how do your agents currently access technical documentation and product specs, and how often do they need to put customers on hold to research answers?\n\n- With your business operating across multiple locations (Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee), how do you ensure consistent service quality when you can only review a small sample of customer interactions for coaching purposes?\n\n- During your peak seasons or when launching new products like the Alpha Class heat pumps, how do you quickly scale up your contact center capacity without compromising service levels?\n\n- When customers have complex technical questions about your data center cooling solutions, how long does it typically take agents to create accurate call summaries and follow-up tasks in your current workflow?\n\n- Since you're expanding internationally and serving diverse markets, how do you currently handle non-English speaking customers who need support for your HVAC systems?"
