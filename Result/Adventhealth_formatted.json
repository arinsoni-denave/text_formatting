    "customer engagement suite": {
      "elevator pitch": "AdventHealth's massive digital transformation across 50+ hospitals serving 6.7 million patients annually creates exponential CX complexity. With 70% of healthcare consumers expecting instant 24/7 support and your recent Epic EHR rollout generating increased technical inquiries, patient frustration could spike without proactive intervention.\n\nAre you prepared for the surge in omnichannel support demands as your AI initiatives and telehealth services scale nationwide?\n\nGoogle's Customer Engagement Suite with Dialogflow CX could deflect 50% of routine calls like Marks & Spencer achieved, while our HIPAA-ready platform ensures compliance. Let's explore how intelligent automation could enhance your whole-person care mission.",
      "key insights": "- AdventHealth's 6.7 million annual patients across 50+ hospitals create massive multilingual support demands, which strain current contact centers. CES's Virtual Agents supporting 100+ languages can provide 24/7 patient engagement without geographic constraints.\n\n- Their recent $660M Epic EHR rollout likely increased technical support calls as staff adapt to new workflows, which overwhelms existing agents. CES's Agent Assist with live transcription can reduce resolution times by 90 seconds like Best Buy achieved.\n\n- Managing quality consistency across AdventHealth's nine-state network with manual sampling creates compliance gaps, which risks patient safety standards. CES's Quality AI provides 100% automated scoring versus typical 5% manual coverage.\n\n- Their AI Advisory Board and Coalition for Health AI membership demonstrate innovation appetite, which positions them for advanced automation. CES's elastic CCaaS with pay-per-use scaling can optimize costs during varying patient volume periods."
