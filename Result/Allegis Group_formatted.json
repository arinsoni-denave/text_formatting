However, their core business is workforce solutions rather than customer service operations.

Their tech stack shows strong Google Cloud adoption (BigQuery, Compute Engine, Cloud Platform) and existing CX solutions (Zendesk, Salesforce CRM), but lacks traditional contact center infrastructure. Their AI initiatives and digital transformation focus align with CES capabilities, but the use case fit remains unclear for a B2B staffing company.",

Google CES's Dialogflow CX handles voice and chat in 100+ languages, enabling consistent candidate experiences globally while reducing your need for region-specific contact centers.\n\n- With your recent AI and automation investments in workforce solutions, high-volume candidate inquiries probably overwhelm your recruiting teams during peak hiring seasons. CES virtual agents can deflect up to 50% of routine calls about application status and job requirements, letting your recruiters focus on relationship-building and strategic placements.\n\n- Your Salesforce CRM integration shows you value connected systems, but manual call summaries likely slow down your talent consultants between candidate interactions. Agent Assist provides real-time transcription and AI-generated summaries that integrate directly with Salesforce, cutting post-call admin time by up to 90 seconds per interaction like Best Buy achieved.\n\n- Managing quality across your diverse brands like Aerotek, TEKsystems, and Actalent probably requires extensive manual call monitoring for compliance and coaching. Quality AI automatically scores conversations for adherence and soft skills, giving supervisors targeted coaching insights without listening to every call.\n\n- Your 2024 Strategic Suppliers program evaluation shows you prioritize partnership quality, but tracking supplier response rates and placement quality manually is time-intensive. Conversational Insights can automatically cluster contact themes around supplier performance, surfacing trends the same day for faster decision-making.\n\n- With Oracle Cloud and Microsoft platforms in your tech stack, you need solutions that integrate seamlessly without major infrastructure changes. CES offers one-click connectors to your existing Salesforce, Oracle, and Microsoft systems, plus elastic pay-per-use pricing that scales with your hiring volume fluctuations.\n\n- Your recent Talent Tech Labs acquisition focuses on workforce technology research, indicating you're investing in AI-driven candidate experiences. CES's Gemini-powered agents can handle complex talent inquiries beyond simple FAQs, providing personalized career guidance that enhances your reputation as an industry leader in specialized talent solutions.",

(Yes/No)\n\n- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your organization's current ability to automatically monitor and score customer interaction quality across all your global locations and service channels?\n\n- Do you have established cost-per-contact targets or self-service containment goals that you're actively working to achieve in your customer experience operations?
