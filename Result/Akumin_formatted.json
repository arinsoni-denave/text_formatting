      "artificial intelligence in diagnostic imaging": "AI algorithms are transforming radiology by interpreting medical imaging data, including X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. These advanced technologies can quickly process vast amounts of image data, detect subtle patterns and abnormalities, and promise to enhance diagnostic accuracy and streamline clinical workflows. As of May 2024, the FDA has approved nearly 900 AI- and machine learning-enabled devices, with the vast majority targeting radiology.",
      "mobile medical imaging technologies": "The post-pandemic era has seen a rise in mobile medical imaging technology, enabling easier capture and sharing of patient information. Mobile CT and MR imaging are particularly promising, allowing physicians to take equipment directly to patients, saving time and reducing costs associated with patient transfers. Recent innovations include helium-free mobile imaging technology, such as Philips' BlueSeal MR Mobile, which addresses resource constraints and sustainability issues.",
      "advanced imaging workflow solutions": "Radiology teams are increasingly using AI-powered remote platforms to tackle challenges in medical imaging. These solutions enable teams to remotely acquire images, seamlessly collaborate across multiple locations, allow radiologists to review and interpret imaging studies from anywhere, and provide real-time assistance to technologists across different sites.",
      "precision cancer screening": "AI is rapidly reshaping cancer detection, with remarkable improvements in screening accuracy. For instance, AI-powered breast screening has shown a 21% increase in cancer detection rates. In prostate cancer, AI assistance can reduce missed findings to just 1%, compared to 8% when radiologists work alone. The technology aims to improve disease detection, reduce unnecessary imaging, and make high-quality radiology care more accessible."

      "detailed reasoning": "Akumin operates in healthcare services with $500M-$1B revenue and 1,000-5,000 employees, meeting CES revenue thresholds. However, as a diagnostic imaging company providing radiology/oncology services, they lack the typical contact center scale that CES targets (≥100 agents or ≥2M annual interactions). Their tech stack shows existing CX solutions (Cisco Unified Contact Center Express, Freshdesk, Salesforce CRM) with minimal cloud spend ($4K total). While healthcare requires compliance (likely HIPAA), their core business model doesn't indicate extensive customer service operations that would drive CES adoption.",
      "factors increasing the score": "- Revenue of $500M-$1B meets CES ideal customer profile threshold\n\n- Healthcare industry requires strict compliance and data security standards\n\n- Existing Google Cloud presence with BigQuery and GCP platform usage\n\n- Current use of Salesforce CRM provides integration opportunity\n\n- Recent financial restructuring and digitization focus may drive technology modernization",
      "factors decreasing the score": "- Core business is diagnostic imaging services, not customer-facing contact center operations\n\n- Very low cloud spending ($4K total) suggests limited IT investment capacity\n\n- Already has established CX solutions (Cisco contact center, Freshdesk)\n\n- Business model primarily serves hospitals/health systems rather than high-volume consumer interactions\n\n- Recent cybersecurity incidents may require security investment priorities elsewhere",
      "potential next steps": "- Qualify actual contact center scale and agent count for patient scheduling/support operations\n\n- Explore compliance requirements for patient data handling and assess CMEK/VPC-SC value\n\n- Investigate if recent digitization initiatives include customer experience transformation plans"
